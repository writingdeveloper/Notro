# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are documented in this file.
This project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [2.4.1] - 2026-07-10

### Fixed
- **Auto-update now actually restarts and installs.** In v2.3.0–2.4.0 the updater
  ran the silent installer and quit the app, but Inno's `[Run] postinstall` never
  fires under `/VERYSILENT` (there's no finished page), so the app never came back;
  the quit-vs-install race also left the update unapplied. The updater now writes a
  helper batch that waits for the app to exit, runs the silent install, then
  relaunches the installed exe — the same robust pattern as the pre-installer build.

## [2.4.0] - 2026-07-10

### Added
- **Favorites** — right-click any item to star it. A ★ tab on the new left rail
  shows just favorites, and a Favorites row appears at the top of other views.
- **Collections** — a left rail groups items like Discord's per-server emoji.
  Watched-folder items auto-group by folder name; registered items can be moved
  to a named collection via right-click. The bundled Miku items are grouped as
  **miku**. The rail crosses with the Emoji/Sticker/GIF tabs.
- **Open library folder** — from the tray and the picker settings (⚙), to browse
  the cached assets under `%APPDATA%\Notro`.

## [2.3.0] - 2026-07-10

### Changed
- **Now ships as an installer (`NotroSetup.exe`)** instead of a portable exe.
  Installs to `%LOCALAPPDATA%\Programs\Notro` (no admin rights), adds a Start Menu
  entry and an optional Desktop shortcut, an optional "run at startup" step, and a
  proper uninstaller (Settings → Apps). Fixes the "lost the file / must remember
  where it is" problem of the portable build.
- The auto-updater now downloads `NotroSetup.exe` and runs it silently
  (`/VERYSILENT`) to update in place, replacing the batch self-replace.

### Migration
- **v2.2.0 → v2.3.0 must be done manually once:** the v2.2.0 updater looks for a
  `Notro.exe` asset, which v2.3.0 no longer publishes. Download and run
  `NotroSetup.exe` once; your library (`%APPDATA%\Notro`) and settings carry over.
  From v2.3.0 onward, updates are automatic again.

## [2.2.0] - 2026-07-10

### Added
- **Semi-automatic updater** — Notro checks the GitHub Releases API on startup
  and every 24h, downloads the new `Notro.exe` in the background, verifies its
  **SHA256**, and offers **"Restart to update now"** from the tray. The swap is a
  batch helper that waits for the process to exit, backs up the old exe
  (`.bak` rollback on failure), replaces it, and relaunches. The tray also gains
  a manual **"Check for updates"** item and an **"Automatic update checks"**
  toggle. Frozen (exe) builds only — the dev run (`pythonw notro.py`) never
  updates itself. The exe stays unsigned, so the first launch of a new version
  still shows SmartScreen. Updater strings added in all five languages.
- Release workflow now attaches `Notro.exe.sha256` for update verification.

### Notes
- The v2.1.0 → v2.2.0 hop is the last manual one (v2.1.0 has no updater); from
  v2.2.0 onward, updates are delivered semi-automatically.

## [2.1.0] - 2026-07-10

### Changed
- **Renamed the project from ClipShrink to Notro** — a nod to "not Nitro". What
  began as a clipboard image compressor is now a ToS-safe companion for Discord's
  Nitro-gated emoji/sticker/GIF picker, and the name reflects that. On first
  launch your existing library (`%APPDATA%\ClipShrink`) and settings are migrated
  automatically to the new location (`%APPDATA%\Notro`); if you had "Run at
  Windows startup" enabled, it is re-registered under the new name.
- New app / tray icon.
- Package renamed `clipshrink_app` → `notro_app`, entry point `clipshrink.py` →
  `notro.py`, executable `ClipShrink.exe` → `Notro.exe`.

### Fixed
- Three picker gaps surfaced by a v2.0 spec audit, each fixed with tests
  (49 → 62 passing):
  - **APNG→GIF conversion failure** now falls back to a static first-frame PNG
    and flags the item with a warning badge, instead of aborting registration
    with a misleading "download failed" error (spec §7).
  - **Clipboard image paste** — you can now paste an image straight into the
    picker to add it; previously only drag-and-drop registered files (spec §5).
  - Search moved into the library module as the canonical owner (spec §3).

## [2.0.0] - 2026-07-09

### Added
- **Emoji / Sticker / GIF picker** — a hotkey popup (default `Ctrl+Shift+E`,
  configurable from the tray) that replaces Discord's Nitro-gated picker panel
  without modifying the Discord client:
  - Personal library: register emojis/stickers by pasting a Discord
    "Copy Link" URL, by drag-and-dropping image files, or by watching local
    folders (PNG/GIF/WebP/APNG shown automatically per tab).
  - Animated APNG stickers are converted to GIF on registration (Discord
    does not animate uploaded APNGs).
  - Click an item → the picker hides, focus returns to Discord, and the file
    is pasted into the message box automatically. **Sending (Enter) is always
    up to you** — the app never automates your account (no self-bot behavior).
  - Right-click → paste as CDN link instead of a file, or remove the item.
  - Search by name/keywords, "Recently used" section, Discord-style dark UI.
  - Items over the upload limit: static images are auto-compressed through the
    existing pipeline; oversized GIFs are sent as-is with a warning.
- Tray menu: "Open emoji & sticker picker" and a hotkey selector
  (Ctrl+Shift+E / Ctrl+Alt+E / Ctrl+Shift+Space / Disabled).
- 30 new UI strings translated in all five languages.

### Changed
- Codebase split from a single script into the `clipshrink_app` package
  (config / i18n / compress / clipboard_win / monitor / hotkey / library /
  fetch / tray / app / picker). `clipshrink.py` remains the entry point.
- New dependency: `pywebview` (picker window via Windows 11's built-in
  WebView2). If the WebView2 runtime is missing, the app falls back to
  compression-only mode with a notification.
- EXE size grows to ~36 MB (pywebview + pythonnet runtime; was ~11 MB).

### Notes
- Design constraint (ToS safety): the app never modifies the Discord client
  and never calls Discord APIs with your user token. It only prepares the
  clipboard and simulates a local Ctrl+V — the same class of input automation
  as the Windows emoji panel (Win+.). Recipients see pasted items as image
  attachments/links, not as native inline emojis — that is the honest ceiling
  of a ToS-safe companion tool.

## [1.2.0] - 2026-06-13

### Added
- Spanish (Español) UI translation, bringing supported languages to five:
  English, 한국어, 日本語, 中文(简体), Español.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-06-13

### Added
- Multi-language UI — English, 한국어, 日本語, 中文(简体) — with automatic
  Windows-language detection and a tray **Language** menu (choice is persisted).
- Configurable upload limit (10 / 50 / 500 MB) from the tray **Upload limit** menu,
  matching Discord Free / Nitro Basic / Nitro (persisted).
- Periodic cleanup of old temp files while running (previously only on start/quit).

### Fixed
- Filename collision when two images were compressed within the same second
  (now microsecond-precise) — earlier history entries no longer point to the wrong file.
- Silent failure when the clipboard couldn't be updated (another app holding it)
  now shows a notification instead of doing nothing.
- Transparent images that fall back to JPEG are composited on white instead of
  turning black.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-13

### Added
- Initial public release.
- System-tray app that auto-compresses oversized clipboard images for Discord's
  10 MB free upload limit.
- Detection based on the actual PNG bytes Discord would upload, with a safety margin.
- WebP → JPEG quality fallback, then stepwise downscaling, to fit under the limit.
- Compressed image placed on the clipboard **as a file** for direct Ctrl+V upload.
- Opt-in "Run at Windows startup" toggle, recent-history submenu, and single-instance guard.
- Automatic cleanup of temp files older than 1 day.
